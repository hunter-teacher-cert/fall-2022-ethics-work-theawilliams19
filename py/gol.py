   The Rules of Life:
   Survivals:
   * A living cell with 2 or 3 living neighbours will survive for the next generation.
   Deaths:
   * Each cell with >3 neighbours will die from overpopulation.
   * Every cell with <2 neighbours will die from isolation.
   Births:
   * Each dead cell adjacent to exactly 3 living neighbours is a birth cell. It will come alive in next generation.
   NOTA BENE:  All births and deaths occur simultaneously. Together, they constitute a single generation.
